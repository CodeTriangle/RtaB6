Hi, thanks for showing interest in privacy and this bot. Here's a summary of what info I (telna) save when you play.

### Current season records
When you play the game, a record of your performance is saved so that your progress can be continued at a later date.  
This savefile includes your Discord account ID, the most recent name you played under, and the channel and server you were playing in.  
You can view your current-season data for a channel by typing !rank in that channel.  
You can request to have this data removed, but you will need to stop playing the game in that channel or the data will be automatically re-saved.

### Historical season records
When a season ends, the above record is kept indefinitely in order to track your player level and achievements, as well as for historical interest.  
You can view your historical data for a channel by typing !history in that channel.
You can request to have this data removed by messaging me (telna). Note that if you continue to play in that channel, new data will eventually be saved.

### Server data records
When you set up the bot in your server, a record of the channels it is enabled in is created so that the bot can manage games as it has been instructed.  
This record only includes the Discord ID of each channel the bot runs games in, as well as the Discord ID of the server itself.  
As games are played in your server, current-season and historical records for each player will also be created as described above.  
You can request to have this data removed along with all season records for your server by messaging me (telna) once the bot has been removed from your server.

If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact me.  
Please note that the bot is also open-source, so you can investigate for yourself if you like.  
Thanks for being a part of Race to a Billion!
